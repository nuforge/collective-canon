# Collective Canon

Requesting a "few moments" of attention and perhaps feedback on a project for/related to [Star Trek Adventures](https://modiphius.us/collections/star-trek-adventures-tabletop-rpg). Included below is a link to a "[rough demo](https://www.figma.com/proto/ZGGNjFIBcq5x3Nt5vxcFpK/Star-Trek-Adventures?node-id=2786-38426&node-type=canvas&viewport=107%2C277%2C0.55&t=BJyAVSceXvpc9Sbz-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=2786%3A39238)" for what I'm about to describe.

## **1. The Intention**:

**Star Trek Adventures** and **Captain's Log** seem ripe for a website and/or app for players to collect their **mission logs**. A tool to record adventures, **story events**, **epic dice rolls**, recurring NPCs, **character progression**, etc, for STA (or others) and connecting those individual elements together in **meaningful ways**.

The most basic user interaction would be quick and simple 'Mission Log' entries using an app or website. For example, a couple of sentences or paragraphs for an end of session summary written by each player. A **shared history** could form between players and stories as entries and **links** between them accumulate during and outside gaming sessions. This would require minimal time investment and could be a **personally-optional** choice to participate.

Keeping in spirit with the flexibility Star Trek Adventures has to offer, the complexity of engagement from there would scale by **individual preference**. A simple unique "**quantum signature** " for logs to identify unique or branching "**timelines**," allow for creator-approved canon, **crossovers** with other PC/NPCs/Ships, time travel, time loops, alternate realities, wars, etc. **Admiralty campaigns** which could run in "real time" with multiple play-groups reporting weekly/monthly with a sessions mission progress from their ship and crew.

Becoming a **community-driven project** is one of my intentions and any interest or help at this stage would be greatly appreciated. I really, ultimately, envision an intuitive and **storytelling** and **learning toolbox**; not simply another digital character sheet or dice rolling app for a single TTRPG.

I personally want to use this "thing" I am building in my head. All the tools are available, but **I won't be able to complete this by myself**.

## **2. The (not-so-great) Link**:

The link below points to the prototype app. It's a page hosted on **figma.com** and should open a new window in your browser. (Figma is an online tool for designing apps and websites and sharing those design with teams/clients.)

- [Collective Canon design prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/ZGGNjFIBcq5x3Nt5vxcFpK/Star-Trek-Adventures?node-id=2786-38426&node-type=canvas&viewport=107%2C277%2C0.55&t=BJyAVSceXvpc9Sbz-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&starting-point-node-id=2786%3A39238)

The page should display an animated splash screen on a simulated mobile phone or tablet in your browser page. **IMPORTANT**: This is my first time sharing with Figma, so if your first reaction is "**why would someone post this broken mess/blank page?**" please let me know, so I can figure why others might not be seeing what I'm seeing. I know Figma's previews have an issue with responsive, so everything might be wonky, I can't change that, sadly. There is an option in the menu to adjust aspect resolution.

## **3. Current State**:

Below are some notes on a handful of pages currently accessible through the linked version of the prototype. Heavily under construction, and nothing beyond pages with popups, static text, icons, and links navigating between pages.

- **Links and Buttons**. Clicking on blank spots on the page should reveal what is a clickable link or button. (Figma prototype feature).
- **Press or Hold**. Some of those links require a tap/click and some require click/hold to display popups. This will require a bunch of testing to determine best usability.
- **Splash screen**. Slap-dash animated splash screen, thanks last minute YouTube tutorials (see Caveats).
- **Front Page**. Clicking 'Login' button should open a popup and 'sign in' should bring you to next page. No login info needed.
- **Character sheet**. So many ways to go with this page. Really is going to depend on feedback to find a good default layout. The Bio page is split, and the Lifepath page is only accessible through the pop-out menu. For reasons.
- **Starship**. Like the character sheet but for ships. I didn't put in the tooltips yet, I'll get there. It's a tedious task, but they'd be the same as on character sheet.
- **Mission Logs** this page is super-placeholder and will require programming beyond the scope of Figma to properly demonstrate how navigating logs and information will go.
- **Search Page** Also non-functional. But will be based on the system used by Hydrus Network.
- **Next step**. Once this the prototype is at a point where building it becomes more efficient, the next step will be using as many existing opensource tools as possible to "Tuvix" together a proof of concept app/website!

Also, if you discover you can view or edit the design Figma files, please let me know. ðŸ«¤ You shouldn't be able to do that...

## **4. Want to Help?**:

- **Feedback**. Easiest and most beneficial at this point. Take a moment, look around the link, reply here if you have a thought, or leave a comment directly on the prototype (if you are able).
- **Collaborate**. If anyone wants to collaborate on this (or other projects, I suppose) hit me up and we'll talk.
- **Correct me if I'm wrong**. If you know Figma, design, web/app development or STA and you have insight or advice, please let me know.
- **Be brutal**. The concept is early and rough, so I have little ego invested so far. What doesn't look/feel "good". Better layout suggestions? Features you'd like to see? Does tracking momentum on the top of the app even make sense?
- **Be gentle**. ðŸ˜¬ Positive feedback will likely keep me interested in the project, so encouragement is encouraged.

## **5. Caveats of the Emptor variety**:

- **Logs**. Sadly, the "logs" page doesn't yet show off any of what I described in the pitch.
- **Iterative Prototype**. The intention of this prototype is to get ideas "on paper" as quickly as possibly, test usability, and then adapt the design based on feedback. It will change, hopefully, often and dramatically for the better.
- **Figma Bugs**. For example, in the app, popups should open and close based on clicks. If a popup stays opens, clicking it or the background should close it... usually. On occasion, for reasons I can't determine, some can get stuck open in the preview. Refreshing the app will resolve this.
- **Expect Jank**. On top of that, there may be some inconsistent design and functionality choices. Often a consequence of these "learn-as-you-go" guerilla tactics.
- **Fair Use 'dot dot dot Question Mark?'** I've pulled primarily from the free 2e Quick Start. Hopefully this is all copacetic for my purposes at the moment? I'm not looking to step on any copyright-toes. I could AI the content, but it's more meaningful to demonstrate with STA assets. Any way to get an official word on if it's cool (official legal term) to temporarily use snippets of text and images in this way and share it for brainstorming feedback?
- **"Collective Canon"**. I'm workshopping the name, but I like it in a way. Broad enough to appeal to many beside Star Trek as well.
